*This pipeline is still under development*

## Introduction
nf_CRACpipeline is a nextflow workflow for processing and analyzing CRAC data.
This workflow was rewritten in Nextflow DSL2 based on an earlier version of python script, [CRAC_pipeline_SE_demult_dedup.py](https://github.com/ewallace/Ssd1_CRACanalysis_2020/blob/master/src/CRAC_pipeline_SE_demult_dedup.py) by [Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/) which was used in the paper:
